\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Goal of the work}
Ensuring the anonymity of communication in diverse network systems is a technical challenge that requires specific technical solutions, enabling the realisation of this objective while maintaining the usability of the network system. The aim of this work is to analyse the types of technical solutions currently used in anonymising networks/anonymous communication networks (ACNs) in the context of their usability in specific usage scenarios.

\section{Scope of the work}
This work provides an overview of ACNs, emphasising their technical aspects, identifies potential use cases and application areas, categorises these use cases, presents potential threats, and offers a comparative analysis of existing anonymous communication networks in terms of usability in various scenarios. The work also determines desired directions for the development of ACNs and includes the design and implementation of an educational

\section{Structure of the work}
This work begins with a theoretical introduction explaining all concepts necessary to understand the paper.
After the introduction, an overview of the most prominent ACNs is provided, focusing on those most popular today and those that have significantly influenced current solutions.
Following the overview, the use cases for ACNs are proposed. The use cases are then organised into groups of similar requirements. The criterias for each group are selected and weighted appropriately.
After presenting the use cases, relevant threats - including limitations and possible attacks - are discussed.
Subsequently, the technical comparison of the most popular ACNs and their technical solutions is carried out in two stages. The first stage is the comparison based solely on the literature. Then, the experiments are performed and the results are used in the second stage - an empirical and experimental comparison.
After the comparisons, the ACNs are evaluated in terms of usability for the identified use case groups and their requirements. Based on this evaluation, the best-suited ACN for each use case group is identified.
Following the analysis, future directions for ACNs are described.
After presenting future directions, an educational demonstrator is designed to verify and illustrate the ACN analysis.
Finally, the work concludes with a summary of the findings and a discussion of the results.
